# Caras y gestos (Charades)
Project URL: http://18.221.160.127/caras-y-gestos/

Web app that provides movie titles randomly, which can be used to play 'caras y gestos' (charades).
The rules must be set by the group of people who is playing the game, reason why the web app or project, will not change the way they like to play.

## How to play
Start using this app is very simple!

### Start playing
Just **press the big blue button** and the application will provide you a movie title that can be interpreted by the player in turn.
You will see a little button next to the movie title. This option will allow you to 'hide' and show the current movie to be interpreted.

### Reset the game
In the top right corner you will find a ***new game* option** and accept the prompt.

### Used movies
In the bottom you will find an used movies option that will allow you to see the movies that have been used in the current game session.

## Notes
- The game is in active development.
- I develop this game in my free times.

### Warning
- The game is currently only available in spanish, with the mexican translation titles.
